Welcome to modepy's documentation!
==================================

.. module:: modepy

:mod:`modepy` helps you create well-behaved high-order discretizations on
simplices (i.e. triangles and tetrahedra) and tensor products of simplices
(i.e. squares, cubes, prisms, etc.). These are a key building block for
high-order unstructured discretizations, as often used in a finite element
context. It closely follows the approach taken in the book

  Hesthaven, Jan S., and Tim Warburton. "Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods:
  Algorithms, Analysis, and Applications". 1st ed. Springer, 2007.
  `Book web page <http://nudg.org>`_

The basic objects that :mod:`modepy` manipulates are functions on a simplex.
For example, it supplies an orthonormal basis on triangles (shown here) and tetrahedra.

Here's an idea of code that uses :mod:`modepy`:
