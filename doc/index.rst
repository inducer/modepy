Welcome to modepy's documentation!
==================================

.. module:: modepy

:mod:`modepy` helps you create well-behaved high-order discretizations on
simplices (i.e. triangles and tetrahedra) and tensor products of simplices
(i.e. squares, cubes, prisms, etc.). These are a key building block for
high-order unstructured discretizations, as often used in a finite element
context.

The basic objects that :mod:`modepy` manipulates are functions on a shape (or
reference domain). For example, it supplies an orthonormal basis on triangles
(shown below).

as :download:`examples/plot-basis.py <../examples/plot-basis.py>`.

Its roots closely followed the approach taken in the Hesthaven and Warburton
book [HesthavenWarburton2007]_, but much has been added beyond that basic
functionality.

Example
-------

Here's an idea of code that uses :mod:`modepy`:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/prism-forms.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :lines: 3-
    :lineno-start: 3
    :caption: Example code that constructs a prism domain and computes a weak derivative on it.

This file is included in the :mod:`modepy` distribution as
:download:`examples/prism-forms.py <../examples/prism-forms.py>`.
