Installation
============

This command should install :mod:`modepy`::

    pip install modepy

If you are installing :mod:`modepy` into a global environment, you may need
additional permissions (e.g. :command:`sudo`). If you do not have
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ installed, you can easily get it
using::

    python -m ensurepip

For a more manual installation: download the source, unpack it, and run::

    python -m pip install .

or (for development purposes)::

    python -m pip install --editable .

This will also install any required dependencies like :mod:`numpy` if they are
not available already.
